           <p>Hi there! I'm Muhammad Ahmad Nadeem, and I'm really excited to tell you a bit about myself. I'm currently studying at PUCIT (Punjab University College of Information Technology) where I'm working towards my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BsIT) degree. I'm set to graduate in 2027.
            <br>
            My journey into the world of technology began in a GOVT college, where I finished my Intermediate studies. Originally from a quiet village in South Punjab, I moved to Lahore in 2008, and I've loved it ever since. Lahore is often called the heart of Pakistan, and it's been a great place for me to learn and grow.
            <br>
            I've always been fascinated by computers and how they work. That's what led me to start learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, Python, R, and MYSQL. These languages help me create all sorts of cool stuff, like websites and software. Right now, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript, which is another language that lets me do even more awesome things with code.
            <br>
            Even though I'm still in school, I've already worked on lots of different projects. Each project has been a chance for me to learn something new and improve my skills. You can see some of the projects I've worked on in the Projects section of this website.
            <br>
            One important thing to know about me is that I prefer to work remotely. That means I do most of my work from home because I have 24/7 internet connection. This setup works well for me because it gives me the flexibility to manage my schoolwork and projects effectively. But once I complete my degree, I'd love to join your team as an onsite employee if the opportunity arises.
            <br>
            Outside of my studies and work, I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's creating software that helps people or finding innovative solutions to problems, I believe technology has the power to change lives for the better.
            <br>
            When I'm not busy with school or coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech trends, chatting with friends, or enjoying the sights and sounds of Lahore.
            <br>
            I'm really looking forward to what the future holds, and I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey!</p>
